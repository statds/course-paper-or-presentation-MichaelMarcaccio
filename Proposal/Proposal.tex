\section*{Introduction}
Call centers are a staple of the finanical industry with agents working in the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa \citep{ibrahim2016modeling}. 
Effective management is essential to running call centers and businesses are consistently trying to model and optimize when customers are calling with questions. 
\citet*{evensen1999effective} describes the recent growth of call centers as being, "viewed as little more than lower cost channels for customer
problem resolution, are quickly becoming a powerful means of service delivery with a potential for substantial revenue generation".
I have chosen this to be my topic of study as I have a strong interest in working in the finanical industry after graduation and I have an unique opportunity to utilize real-world data from an undisclosed
finanical firm. Due to this, My findings may provide insight that would benefit the company and its members.

\section*{Specific Aims}
I will be attempting to model call volume per a 15 minute interval and determining if there is any seasonality in the calls.
