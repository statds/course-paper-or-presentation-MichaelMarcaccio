With over 15 million people employed, a predicted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.6 percent between 2020 and 2027, and with over 28,000 locations in the United States alone, call centers play a pivotal role in a business' success.In this paper, call center volume was forecasted and models were created to predict the number of agents needed to meet critical attributes such as waittime, calltime, and holdtime.Forecasting gives businesses the ability to make informed business decision and develop data-driven strategies. In the literature it is very common to see call center volume being predicted using different techniques, but there is very limited studies on attempting to correlate the number of agents needed. Through Regression techniques, there are 8 models proposed to model the number of agents needed based on waittime, calltime, goaltime, and the amount of calls handled.
